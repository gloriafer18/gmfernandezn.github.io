# Who am I?

My name is Gloria Milena Fernández Nieto. I am originally from Bogotá, Colombia, and have a passion for data, analytics, and visualisations. My interest in using data to support others' practices grew 
during both my bachelor's and master's degrees. I am a computer system engineer and obtained my degree in 2012 from the Universidad Distrital and my master degree in 2015 from Universidad de Los 
Andes.  
In 2023, I completed my PhD in Learning Analytics. I am fascinated by the potential of physical and online data traces that could be used to support a better understanding of learning/teaching activities. Data traces are valuable resources 
for teachers and students to identify insights and reflect on their co-located activities such as teamwork, collaboration, self-regulated learning, or spatial behaviours.

# Current work

I'm a Research Fellow at the Faculty of Information Technology, [Monash University](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/gloria-fernandez-nieto), Australia. My research focuses on designing and 
deploying innovative tools to enhance teaching and learning analytics across physical and digital spaces.

My work aims to find the optimal alignment between learning pedagogies and the potential of emerging technologies, providing lasting support for both learners and educators.

Key areas of my research include:
* Knowledge Management Systems: I work on the design and development of a system that facilitate knowledge management within communities of practice for educators. My research includes the exploration 
of the role of data comics, a storytelling approach, in communicating and disseminating knowledge within the context of teachers' natural  workflows.
This research is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA-KMASS) under the "Large-scale multimodal knowledge management: From organization and user modelling to fast contextual presentation" project.
* Teamwork Analytics: I investigate the use of data traces to provide feedback through visualisations and **data storytelling** elements, assisting teachers and students in their sensemaking 
processes.

# About my research

I explore alternative feedback methods to analyse learner and educator digital/physical traces, aiming to stimulate reflection in teaching and learning practices. I leverage my expertise in human-computer interaction, collaborative learning, and 
artificial intelligence to design analytics dashboards, knowledge management systems, and data storytelling tools for regular classrooms and healthcare settings. Recently, I pioneered the application 
of different forms of participatory design such as **co-design** at the intersection of education and data science.
